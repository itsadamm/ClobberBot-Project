<h1>
Program 4: Clobber Bot game</h1>
Classes: yourLoginName.java (and any additional classes you think are appropriate)
<hr>

<h3> Description:</h3>
<p>In this assignment, you will develop an agent (or bot) for a video game.  More than 1 copy of your bot 
may be placed in the game.  So, for maximum performance you will need to make your bots cooperate with each other
- at a minimum they shouldn't intentionally shoot each other.  

I plan on running tournaments with teams of size 1, 2, and 4.  I'll run the tournaments as 1 team vs 1 team round 
robbin, and free-for-all (everybody all at once).  

There are two goals in the game:
<ul>
    <li>Destroy as many of the other bots in the game as possible by shooting them or ramming them (but if you
    ram them you die too, so that may not be the best strategy) - worth +10 points for each kill.</li>
    <li>Survive to the end of the game - worth +40 points.</li>
    <li>The score for all copies of your bots will be summed.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
I have provided <a href="clobber.tar.gz"> the game code </a> and examples of bots.  You will want to look at these bots as potential 
starting points for your bot.  In particular, look at ClobberBot4.java to see how you can read through the world state (WhatIKnow.java 
class) to see where everything is.  The best performing bot is ClobberBot6.java.
</p>


<h3> Program Requirements:</h3>

<p>
Your bot should extend the ClobberBot class and override the toString, drawMe, and takeTurn methods.
</p>

<p>
The main thing for your bot is performance.  
In terms of performance, your bot should outperform the bots that have been provided as examples.  
To do that you'll need to somehow improve on ClobberBot6's performance, which may not be all that easy to do.  You can
use it as a starting point, or code your own bot up from scratch.  Make sure you report on the performance of 
your bot vs ClobberBot6.  
</p>


<p>
When the Clobber game queries your bot for an action (calls the takeTurn method), your takeTurn method must return 
that action in a timely manner.  
Bots that take too long will be penalized.  How long is too long?  Certainly a 10th of a second is too long.
For example, if you want to do 30 frames a second, and you've got, say, 20 bots in the game, then each bot 
can only take *at most* 1/600 of a second to make a decision every turn.  For this program try to keep your 
decision making time to less than 1/100 of a second.  If you go above that you're going to start to be penalized.
</p>

<p>
Your drawMe method also should be very fast.  It should take at most something like 1/10,000 of a second.  Whatever
you decided to draw for your agent, it should be centered on the point passed into the method and shouldn't exceed
the agent girth (see Clobber.java for the maximum girth).
</p>

<p>
Your toString method should return the string "yourLoginName" (where "yourLoginName" is your login name on onyx,
which also happens to be the name of your main class for this assignment).
</p>

<h3> Objectives:</h3>

<ul>
    <li> Learn how program an adjent that functions in a multi-agent environment.  </li>
    <li> Learn how to make teams of agents cooperate. </li>
    <li> Beat the pants off your fellow students </li>
</ul>

<hr>
<h3> Readme:</h3>
</p><p>
You should also include a professional quality writeup of 5 to 8 (or so, single spaced)  pages that describes the overall design of your
bot.  In particular, include a description of the algorithm you use in your takeTurn method. Also include your implementation plan in the readme file.
You can also include any other information you think I should know when I'm grading your program.  If you have ideas for how
to improve the program, you could mention those as well.  Make sure you report on your own performance results/tests.

</p><hr>
<h3>
Testing:</h3>
<p>We have provided the Clobber game program that you can use to run your bot.
Other than that it is up to you to decide what testing you need to do.
Make sure you talk about your test methodology in your readme file.

</p><hr>
<h3>
Submission:</h3>
Required files (be sure the names match what is here exactly):
<ul>
<li> yourLoginName.java </li>
<li> readme</li>
</ul>
All the files that are relevant to this assignment should be together in
a single directory (the name of your directory does not matter). 
Remove all class files and any other extraneous files before submitting.
